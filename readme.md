## **Course Overview**
ASP.NET Core 2.0 is the latest release of Microsoftâ€™s cross-platform version of its ASP.NET
Web development framework. This ASP.NET Core 2.0 training teaches attendees the skills
necessary to design and build well-architected web and service-oriented applications that
follow the MVC design pattern.

The Docker portion of this training teaches students how to use Docker to create a
consistent testing and deployment target for ASP.NET Core applications. Attendees also
learn multi-container applications, orchestration, continuous integration, and deployment.
